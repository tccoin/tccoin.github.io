- Developed a combined system to detect and locate pedestrians and estimate their biological information. Implemented gesture control based on individual interactions.  
- Obtained 720P RGBD images with a 3-D TOF infrared camera.  
- Applied YOLO and a separate CNN model to identify pedestrians and guess their age and gender. 
- Used Leap Motion for tracking gestures in close interactions.
