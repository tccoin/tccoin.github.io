- Obtained the original sample data of Dingxiangyuan (a medical knowledge sharing website) rumors and joint anti-rumor platform on the Internet with Python crawler. 
- Segmented the corpus with Jieba, calculated word vectors and text relevance using SBERT, and applied BIRCH clustering and high frequency words analysis.  
- Conducted fine-tuning of BERT models to realize semantic inferences (also NLI).
