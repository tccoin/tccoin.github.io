- Built a SLAM system from scratch using ROS, including FCOS network for object detection, an OpenCV frontend, and a GTSAM backend with loop-closing.
- Trained FCOS network to extract object positions in the scene and further optimized in the backend.
- Improved frontend multi-frame feature matching to ~300 matches per frame with correspondence search.
- Used factor graphs and in GTSAM to optimize and fuse factors like landmarks, IMU, and objects.
